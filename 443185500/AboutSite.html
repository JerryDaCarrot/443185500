      <h2>Tell me about the site in general.</h3>
      <div id="BM">This site intends to inform the viewer on our planet's oceans and other waterways. It uses a variety of aspects to create a cohesive website that has a clear navigation system and allows the user to find information easily. It has been styled with a simple colour scheme and has incorporated many aspects of other websites to create a design already known to viewers.</div><br>
      This website has 1 titular page which introduces the topic and provides information that is built upon later. The next 3 pages contain specific information on the general topic with information on aspects that are relevant to the topics. The 5th page is a fun page that provides fun facts and has a fun “test yourself” aspect, designed for children to add interest to the site. The next page is a donation page, where the user is able to make a donation through the website to the charity, and it leads to a thank you page. The final page is this about site page.

<h2>Document the things about your site that deserve bonus marks.</h2>
        <h6>Focus on colour</h6>
        Throughout my website I have used the colour #1bc2f0 to create a cohesively styled work. It has been picked from a picture that was used in the site in order to link all aspects of it.
        <h6>Parallax Effect: Home Page</h6>
        This was implemented in order to create a visually pleasing design that would allow the user to get a grasp of the main points of the website. This is a good way to demonstrate the technical aspects of the design. 
      <h6>  Flexbox design and boxes: Beach Page</h6>
        This major use of design features incorporated the use of many flexboxes to specifically style the images and text. These images + text are each surrounded by a box which is in the website's signature colour. 
        <h6>Hover to show text: Marine Life Page</h6>
        This allows the user to see the images of the sea creatures and then find out what that means. This is a simple technique that makes a difference to the website.
        <h6>Hover to increase text size: Fun Facts Page</h6>
        This allows the user to focus on specific facts and is yet another very simple technique used to create dramatic effect.
        <h6>Donation Form: Donate Now Page</h6>
        This uses the form technique to provide an opportunity for the user to "donate" to this (charity) site, and creates interactivity within it. 
       <h6> Favicon was hand drawn: All Pages </h6>
        <div id="CC">The favicon and the logo (found on the footer), are the same hand drawn image. I have used this image to reflect the values of my website, as it demonstrates the water aspects as well as the company (of the website's) name, Save Earth.</div>
