     <div class="ca"> A crisis is sweeping through our world. CO2 emissions are at a 2 million year high, and our world is having more frequent and intense droughts, storms and heat waves. Rising sea levels, melting glaciers and warming oceans are directly harm animals, destroying the places they live, and wreaking havoc on people's livelihoods and communities.</div><br>
     
      We are a charity that aims to "Save Earth". We provide information on many natural features in the hopes that people will join our struggle to slow climate change and make a difference to our world. Today we will be focusing on waterways. <br><br>

      <p id="info"><h4>We live on a blue planet, with oceans and seas covering more than 70 per cent of the Earth's surface. Oceans feed us, regulate our climate, and generate most of the oxygen we breathe.</h4></p> 
  
      <p> Oceans also serve as the foundation for much of the world's economy, supporting sectors from tourism to fisheries to international shipping.
  
  But despite their importance, oceans are facing unprecedented threats as a result of human activity. Every year, an estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic waste end up in the world's oceans. At the same time, climate change is damaging coral reefs and other key ecosystems; overfishing is threatening the stability of fish stocks; nutrient pollution is contributing to the creation of dead zones; and nearly 80 per cent of the world's wastewater is discharged without treatment.

<p>With every breath we take, every drop we drink, we're connected to the ocean. Our planet depends on the vitality of the ocean to support and sustain it. But our ocean faces major threats: global climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, invasive species, and a dramatic decrease in ocean fish stocks. These threats to the ocean are so extensive that more than 40 percent of the ocean has been severely affected and no area has been left untouched. Consequently, humanity is losing the food, jobs, and critical environmental services that a healthy ocean generates. National Geographic Society's Ocean Initiative aims to restore health and productivity to the ocean by inspiring people to care and act, reducing the impact of fishing, and promoting the creation of marine protected areas.
